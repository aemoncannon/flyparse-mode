Flyparse-mode is an emacs minor-mode designed to support the creation of programming-language major-modes. Flyparse uses external parsers to generate s-expression ASTs for language files, as they are being edited. Language modes are then able to query these ASTs using a declarative search syntax.

Features:

* Pluggable architecture. It doesn't matter how you implement the parser, as long as it supports the flyparse protocol. 

* Simple and unobtrusive. Can be used to compliment an existing language mode. 

* Provides an intuitive query language for accessing the parse-trees. For example, to get a list of all javascript function names in a file, you might say: (flyparse-query-all '("PROGRAM" "FUNCTION_DECLARATION" "FUNCTION_NAME" "IDENT")). 

* Supports cross-file queries; it's very simple to implement a 'jump to definition' helper (see the included AS3 helpers). 

* Provides helper functions to pretty-print a buffer's syntax tree or to overlay a shaded depth representation over the buffer (see images below). 

* Includes parsers for javascript, css and actionscript 3. 

* Allows for the creation of robust, readable language helpers.
