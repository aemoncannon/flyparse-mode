/**
 *  The IChildList interface defines the properties and methods
 *  for accessing and manipulating child lists, which are subsets
 *  of a DisplayObjectContainer's children.
 *
 *  <p>As an example, consider the Container class.
 *  It overrides DisplayObjectContainer APIs such as the 
 *  <code>numChildren</code> and <code>getChildAt()</code> methods
 *  to access only "content" children, which are the controls
 *  and other containers that you put inside it.
 *  But a Container can also have additional children
 *  created automatically by the framework, such as a background or border
 *  skin and scrollbars.
 *  So Container exposes a property called <code>rawChildren</code> 
 *  of type IChildList, which lets you access all its children,
 *  not just the content children.</p>
 *
 *  <p>As another example, the SystemManager class is a DisplayObjectContainer
 *  whose children are partitioned into various layers:
 *  normal children like the Application are on the bottom,
 *  popups above them, tooltips above them, and cursors on the top.
 *  The SystemManager class has properties named <code>popUpChildren</code>,
 *  <code>toolTipChildren</code>, and <code>cursorChildren</code>
 *  which let you access these layers, and the type of each of these
 *  properties is IChildList.
 *  Therefore, you can count the number of popups using the 
 *  <code>systemManager.popUpChildren.numChildren</code> property,
 *  insert another DisplayObject into the tooltip layer using the 
 *  <code>systemManager.toolTipChildren.addChild()</code> method, and so on.</p>
 *
